Creating 3 Subnet

Goal: Divide the network 192.165.20.0 into at least 3 subnets.

Step 1: What is a Subnet?
-------------------------
A subnet (short for sub-network) is a smaller part of a larger network.
Subnetting allows us to divide one large network into smaller, manageable sections.

Step 2: Identify the IP Class
-----------------------------
IP Address: 192.165.20.0
This is a Class C address (starts with 192).
Default subnet mask for Class C: 255.255.255.0 → /24

Step 3: How Many Bits to Borrow?
--------------------------------
We need at least 3 subnets.

Subnets are calculated in powers of 2:
2^1 = 2 subnets → Not enough
2^2 = 4 subnets → ✅ Enough!

So, we borrow 2 bits from the host portion.

New subnet mask: /24 + 2 = /26
Which is: 255.255.255.192

Step 4: What Do We Get with /26?
--------------------------------
Total subnets = 2^2 = 4
Hosts per subnet = 2^6 = 64 (6 bits left for host)
Usable IPs per subnet = 64 - 2 = 62 (excluding network & broadcast addresses)

Final Answer:
-------------
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.192 or /26

Step 5: The 4 Subnets
---------------------
| Subnet # | Network Address   | Usable IP Range                  | Broadcast Address    |
|----------|--------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------|
| 1        | 192.165.20.0       | 192.165.20.1 – 192.165.20.62     | 192.165.20.63        |
| 2        | 192.165.20.64      | 192.165.20.65 – 192.165.20.126   | 192.165.20.127       |
| 3        | 192.165.20.128     | 192.165.20.129 – 192.165.20.190  | 192.165.20.191       |
| 4        | 192.165.20.192     | 192.165.20.193 – 192.165.20.254  | 192.165.20.255       |

Each subnet has 62 usable IP addresses.
